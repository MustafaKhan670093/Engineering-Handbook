# About

## Positionality

## Who I am

My name is Mustafa Khan and I am an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto. My goal as an engineer is to solve some of the worldâ€™s most challenging problems and improve the lives of billions of people. To achieve this end, continual reflection and action is needed so I can keep improving my skills as an engineer.

## Why I made this website

This website is a living document that allows me to document and reflect on the action I have taken throughout my engineering work. It is not all encompassing of the work I do and often focuses on limitations of tried methods, lessons learned and areas of improvement. If you would like to know more about the work I generally do, please visit my [main website](www.mustafarehanahmadkhan.com).
