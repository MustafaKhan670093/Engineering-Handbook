# About

## Who I am

</div>

My name is Mustafa Khan and I am an Engineering Science student at the University of Toronto. My goal as an engineer is to solve some of the worldâ€™s most challenging problems and improve the lives of billions of people. To achieve this end, continual reflection and action is needed so I can keep improving my skills as an engineer.

## Why I made this website

This website is a living document that allows me to document and reflect on the action I have taken throughout my engineering work. It is not all encompassing of the work I do and often focuses on limitations of tried methods, lessons learned and areas of improvement. If you would like to know more about the work I generally do, please visit my [main website](https://www.mustafarehanahmadkhan.com).

## Engineering values

As described in my [position statement](https://youtu.be/7aTpYbrz77s) from the beginning of Praxis II, I fundamentally aim to:

* Solve high impact problems that improve people's lives
* Be a lifelong learner 
* Create fun and interesting solutions to challenging problems
* Gain new and enlightening experiences

These core values have not changed, although the process described in that video has changed significantly. This handbook seeks to describe this new process in greater detail.

## My Engineering Design Process

</div>

This process is heavily inspired by the **Framing, Diverging, Converging and Representing (FDCR) model** taught in **Praxis** at **UofT**. It also borrows from [(**Design Council, 2006**)](https://www.designcouncil.org.uk/sites/default/files/asset/document/ElevenLessons_Design_Council%20(2).pdf) who begin their process with a **Discovery** phase and with a **Deliver** phase. Likewise, my process includes an **Identifying Opportunities** section to the FDCR process at the beginning and I close the loop by conducting **Stakeholder Validation**. The tools, models and frameworks invoked along the way arise from a range of sources and are more thoroughly explained and analyzed throughout this handbook.

## Navigating this site

These are the major aspects of my engineering design process: 

* **Framing**, 
* **Diverging**, 
* **Converging**,
* **Representing**. 

This site is organized to explain these sequentially. In each section there are notes, examples and lessons regarding the use of relevant tools, models and frameworks that I incorporate into my engineering design process in order to augment the FDCR model. There is also an engineering products page that details some engineering products I have created during my first year of university. The goal of this section is to relate the tools, models and frameworks described throughout my engineering design process to concrete examples where they have been applied.
