# Diverging Process

## What is Diverging?

Diverging is the process of developing solutions to a given opportunity. This phase of the design process is characterized by creative thinking, studying existing reference designs, developing out of the box solutions, and exploring the solution space of an opportunity. There are several tools, models and frameworks that can be used in order to facilitate diverging. Notable ones include:

* BrainWriting 6-3-5
* Wishing
* MORPH Chart
* System 1 and 2 Thinking
* SCAMPER Transformations

## BrainWriting 6-3-5

BrainWriting 6-3-5 requires that a maximum of 6 people generate 3 ideas each which are then passed around the table once to be built upon by others. This is then repeated 5 times. 

#### When And How To Use BrainWriting 6-3-5

BrainWriting 6-3-5 is most successfully used when diverging for the first time with a new team. It can be conducted on easily modifiable and shareable mediums such as blank pieces of paper that can be passed around (if in person) and Google Slides or Google JamBoard (if done virtually). 

:::tip Advantages
* BrainWriting 6-3-5 addresses “the potential deficiencies of brainstorming (uneven participation and verbally led) by **encouraging participation from all, with an emphasis on sketching of ideas**” (Source). It also successfully avoids anchoring of ideas by making individuals ideate individually before sharing their designs.
* BrainWriting is very similar to classical brainstorming in the manner individuals perform brainstorming, which makes it **easy to introduce and use** regardless of team member’s past experience with using ideation strategies and tools.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* By itself, **BrainWriting 6-3-5 is insufficient for late stage diverging** since a lot of the ideas generated arise from personal experience of the designing team and minimal web searches, which produce great ideas but highly unrefined designs.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* **Focused BrainWriting** is a term I have coined which describes taking the structure of BrainWriting but reducing the number of sessions conducted while increasing the designing and research time given to team members. This enables the development of designs with a lot of detail and allows teams to leverage the advantages of BrainWriting during late stage diverging.

## Wishing

Wishing begins with the sentence: **“I wish…”**, a powerful method of diverging solutions. Through that exposition, this tool encourages the engineer or their team members to think of idealistic, wishful and fantastical solutions to an opportunity. 

#### When And How To Use Wishing

This is best used during the middle stage of diverging when it feels like ideas have run out and there is not much left to explore. 

:::tip Advantages
* **Expands the solution space** by encouraging the development of ideas that are beyond sensible or feasible. This is especially useful for creative roadblocks and helps team morale during such times since admittedly, the tool is very enjoyable to use. 
* The tool **eliminates fear** by being centered around wishing. Our wishes need not be realistic. This legitimizes statements that others may be too afraid to say out loud for fear of mockery or their reputation being impacted.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* It is very likely that you will come up with wild and infeasible ideas which are just that, **wild and infeasible**.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* Wishing can very successfully be **paired with the Challenging Assumptions** tool. This tool requires users list their assumptions regarding an opportunity or challenge and then ask “What if … was not true?”. This can be used to encourage wishful thinking, thereby strengthening the use of the Wishing tool during diverging.
Creating a **MORPH chart of** all of the interesting **ideas developed using wishing** is a step that can be taken to avoid conducting a wishing session, producing incredulous ideas and then never using them. Instead, a MORPH chart provides a systematic means of applying different ideas being developed to create a design that could in fact be created.
:::

## MORPH Chart

A morphological (MORPH) chart is a visual tool that deconstructs a product into its functions and explores a range of possible solutions to achieve that function. Finally, different combinations of these solutions can be pieced together to create a range of solutions that all have the functionality required for the final solution.

#### When And How To Use A MORPH Chart

This is best used during mid-to-late stage diverging when there are one or two solutions that stand out really well. MORPH charts can refine design ideas through considering different combinations of solutions that achieve intended product functionality. 

:::tip Advantages
* MORPH charts are **visual tools** that make it **very easy to see connections** between different design ideas. 
* **Encourages** the **investigation of boundary conditions**. In other words, if a design achieves one product function, what are the limits or extremes of what can be changed with that design while still achieving intended functionality.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* MORPH charts are **very structured and may inhibit creative thinking**. 
* It **requires some practice** to get used to seeing and using since there are no guidelines for how to do combinations. Additionally, **individual designs** that target certain product functions **in a MORPH chart may not work together when pieced together**.
* MORPH charts may yield **too many possibilities**. 
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* A strategy to combine solutions effectively is to **consider whether the combinations are getting closer to or farther away from achieving framed objectives** and whether the **design is possible to prototype** in some capacity.

## System 1 and 2 Thinking

Nobel Prize winning psychologist Daniel Kaheneman proposed a framework of thinking known as System 1 (fast, instinctive and emotional) and System 2 (slow, deliberate and logical) thinking. The diagram describes the proposed dichotomy in human thought more clearly.

#### When And How To Use System 1 and 2 Thinking

System 1 thinking is useful to get through quick tasks that don’t require a lot of creativity or logical reasoning. System 2 thinking is beneficial during the diverging and converging process.

Dr. Kaheneman’s research states that “errors of intuitive judgement” are caused by “time pressure”, “concurrent involvement in a different cognitive task” and by performing tasks at suboptimal times (Kahneman). When this occurs, individuals fall into System 1 thinking and avoid the creativity, deep thought and rigour that System 2 thinking affords. I have encouraged System 2 thinking in the past during the diverging process by beginning early, having several diverging sessions and never rushing my team when conducting creative exploration.


:::tip Advantages
* This framework **makes a team aware of different biases or cognitive traps** they might fall into. Correcting or accounting for them enables more deliberate diverging and converging.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* The framework proposed by Dr. Kaheneman describes the mechanism by which human thought usually proceeds, however, it does not provide meaningful means of activating System 2 thinking. Instead, additional recommendations from Dr. Kaheneman’s works and from behavioral science research can be invoked in order to achieve this.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* System 2 thought can be activated **using external mechanisms such as social incentives**. In my experience, praise of work, team breaks as well as elements of gamification during the process of idea generation is one way of achieving this. 
* **Multivoting** and a **round robin discussions** are two tools that can be paired with the unique usage of System 1 and System 2 thinking to do preliminary converging. Dr. Kaheneman’s research demonstrates that when faced with a decision, we fall back on System 1 thought first. This could be used as a gauge for whether certain design ideas at the preliminary stages of diverging are worth pursuing. This intuition can be captured through tools such as Multivoting, where the engineer and their team members vote for a few top design ideas. Next, a round robin allows the team to holistically discuss their decision thereby enabling a better selection of designs.

## SCAMPER Transformations

SCAMPER includes a range of transformations that can be applied to a design in order to improve specific aspects of the design. 

#### When And How To Use SCAMPER Transformations

SCAMPER transformations can be used at the beginning of the diverging process, however, I have personally found it is best used during the middle to final stages of diverging. This is done by looking at a design and asking questions related to the mnemonic. For example: “What materials can we substitute or swap to improve the design of the solution?” or “What would happen if you combined one design with another?” and so on and so forth.

:::tip Advantages
* The designs being finalized can be **refined and optimized** with adjustments through the **application of SCAMPER transformations**.
*It is a **general purpose tool** that can be put to **work regardless of the nature of the design** being worked on. 
:::

:::caution Limitations
* If not done in a focused manner during the final stages of diverging, SCAMPER can produce a range of new design ideas and **shift the focus of the team away from the ideas being refined**. 
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* To get the greatest benefit, **use SCAMPER alongside other creative brainstorming and lateral thinking techniques** such as random input.
* The use of **SCAMPER with MORPH Charts** is also another powerful combination that can produce interesting solutions.
