# What is a suitable requirements model?

A **heuristic** for whether a set of **requirements is** [**suitable**](/docs/Framing/framing-process#what-is-framing) can be assessed by:

1. Getting a small group of people (4-5) to briefly read through the requirements,
2. Ask them to use the Framing, Diverging, Converging and Representing (FDCR) process to propose a solution to the opportunity,
3. Do not intervene and simply observe their process.

Then consider the following:

* If the group struggles to identify objectives and metrics you thought were important, then perhaps you need to frame the opportunity better. 

* If they manage to do that but struggle with ideation, then perhaps you have not provided sufficient reference designs or have restricted the solution space with constraining requirements.  

* If they manage to come up with solutions but cannot converge on one, then there is a chance the solutions are all very similar to each other or a method of testing the performance of different solutions using critical metrics may need to be detailed.
