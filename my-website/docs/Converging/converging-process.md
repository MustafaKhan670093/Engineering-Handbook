# Converging Process

## What is Converging?

Converging is the process of determining which solution of the set of diverged ones should be recommended to the stakeholders. This process requires thorough performance testing with testing protocols, assessing whether solutions have met key requirements, a comparison between well performing solutions, stakeholder validation of proposals and a final recommendation of a solution.

## PINC Filter

A PINC Filter is a method of evaluating a design by creating a table that lists the positives, intriguing, negatives, and concerning aspects of a design.

#### When And How To Use A PINC Filter

PINC filters are best used in the mid to final stages of convergence when design ideas need to be finalized before refinement or when a recommendation needs to be made. As shown in the figure above, the filter is used by creating a table on a paper or document and filling out the Positive, Intriguing, Negatives and Concerning categories. 

:::tip Advantages
* The PINC filter can be used for **further brainstorming**. If this is the case, then it has the benefit of outlining interesting and concerning aspects of designs. This can bring attention to more specific aspects of a design than a simple pro and con analysis.
* The tool allows design teams to **holistically converge** on a design idea. Judging designs purely from its performance on critical metrics (such as with a measurement matrix or Pugh chart) may not paint a comprehensive picture of the nature of the solutions. This filter attempts to do so and can help justify design choices, especially if designs performed very similarly during testing.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* This filter **takes a lot of time to use** as it requires considerable reflection and analysis of different aspects of the design. It is possible to use this in a very bare bones manner, however, this approach will not fully leverage the advantages of the tool.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* The PINC filter is **best used after** constructing a **measurement matrix and Pugh chart**. Using the filter as a means to outline what the measurement matrix and the Pugh chart cannot outline is the best way to holistically assess designs and strengthen the convergence process.

## Measurement Matrix And Pugh Chart 

A measurement matrix is a table that contains measurements of the performance of different designs with respect to the framed critical metrics. These performance measurements are arrived at using testing protocols and/or research. A Pugh chart takes the measurement matrix and one of the designs as a reference which all the other solutions will be compared against. If a solution is better than the reference design along a metric, then that metric is given a (+) symbol or a green colour, if it is the same as the reference design it is given a neutral symbol or colour, and if it is worse than the reference it is given a (-) symbol or a red colour. An example of both a measurement matrix and a Pugh chart can be seen above.

#### When And How To Use A Measurement Matrix And Pugh Chart 

The Measurement Matrix and Pugh Chart should be used during the converging phase. It is constructed by taking the final designs that have been developed in the diverging phase and using testing protocols to measure the performance of the solutions with respect to the critical metrics. If a testing protocol is not capable of being used, then researched measurements and approximations can be used as well. This is then recorded in the measurement matrix and turned into a Pugh chart as was previously described.

:::tip Advantages
* The process of constructing the measurement matrix forces the design team to thoroughly test different solutions in a **standardized and comparable manner**. This is beneficial as it makes comparisons between different designs possible.
* The Pugh chart that is constructed from the measurement matrix **provides a holistic picture** of how the different solutions fare when compared to each other.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* The **matrix and chart do not distinguish between fully working designs, prototypes or ideas**. If approximations are made, performance metrics are derived using research and not testing as well as if the matrix and chart were constructed using proxies, then these are imperfect depictions of the performance of each solution against each other. 
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* **Have footnotes that clearly state assumptions** (such as the performance of the proxies give useful information of fully designed solutions) when constructing the matrix and chart. This will help teammates and stakeholders understand how the decision making was conducted. 
* Sometimes comparisons along a metric are difficult to do, such as with cost. This is because once a design is fully finished its cost of manufacturing may vary and in the diverging and converging phase it is often difficult to assess this. A good rule of thumb for comparisons along such metrics is to **treat all solutions with the same order of magnitude as the same** and **only say a solution is worse or better** along a metric **if there is an order of magnitude difference** that distinguishes that solution from the others.

## Research Triangulation

Triangulating research is the process of corroborating a finding through multiple sources of information. 

#### When And How To Conduct Research Triangulation

Research triangulation should occur at all stages of the engineering design process. However, it is most important during framing and converging. Framing a solution involves detailing the metrics, criteria and constraints of the design space. This needs to be conducted with rigour as well as reliability and so requires careful triangulation of sources used to make claims. When converging, the testing protocols used and the justification for their use must also follow a similar process in order for the proposed design to be credible. 

:::tip Advantages
* Corroborating findings **increases the reliability and credibility of the engineering design work** being conducted. It also ensures that there are a multiplicity of perspectives involved when making engineering claims.
* Research triangulation does not only have to be done with academic sources but **can also be done through secondary sources and stakeholder interactions**, though may require some more critical thought as anecdotal evidence can be rich with information but potentially biased.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* There is **no established method of conducting triangulation** and it is **challenging to assess whether** the **sources** being found themselves **are credible**. 
* This process of corroborating findings is highly time consuming.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* The use of the **CRAAP test** can greatly augment the process of research triangulation. This involves considering the **currency, relevance, authority accuracy and purpose of different sources** in order to ensure that credible sources are being used when triangulating findings. 
* Note that **not all aspects of the CRAAP test need to be conducted** as academic sources are usually credible. Nevertheless, it is useful when engaging with stakeholders, web sources and other secondary sources. This can **reduce the time** it takes to triangulate research.

## Stakeholder Validation 

Stakeholder Validation is the process of authenticating a design by running the idea through a stakeholder relevant to the opportunity at hand.

#### When And How To Use Stakeholder Validation

This process is useful when trying to converge on a solution. Involving the stakeholders in this process, briefing them on the design, demonstrating key aspects of it and then using curated questions or even tests to determine if the design was successful are ways of validating a design.

:::tip Advantages
* This process applies a **principle of participatory design** and is useful as it **involves those that a solution is being created for** in the design and decision making process. 
* This **increases the credibility of the design** and the likelihood that it is actually useful to a community or set of stakeholders.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* There is **no set method of conducting stakeholder validation**. It varies from interaction to interaction and needs to be developed anew for different stakeholders. 
* **Imperfect communication can make it difficult to determine whether a design is being authenticated correctly**. Conducting such conversations with stakeholders is more an artform than a science, especially if the stakeholders are not personally connected to you, may be in administrative positions, parts of vulnerable groups and so on and so forth.
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* It is important to **have a representation that is easy to understand and which illustrates key aspects of the proposed design** when presenting design work to stakeholders. Unfortunately, engineers are often faced with the curse of knowledge. Knowing too much about the ins and outs of a project and solution, it becomes harder to present only what is necessary for others to see regarding the project. Avoiding this cognitive bias can be achieved by trying to **explain concepts without unnecessary jargon, leveraging visuals and showing rather than telling**. 
* Ensure that **verification is conducted independently with the design team before conducting stakeholder validation**. This process can be better understood using the V model of design and is essential to ensuring that the design is credible before it is assessed by stakeholders. Not to mention, stakeholders will often want to know about the testing and verification done during your interactions with them.
* Finally, by **preparing pointed questions and tests**, the process of **validating** a design **goes much more smoothly**. This should be done ahead of engaging with the stakeholder. Some notable stakeholder validation testing methods are: wizard of oz usability tests, paper and cardboard based simulations of designs and more high fidelity prototypes and associated testing protocols which the stakeholders can follow.

## Prototyping

A prototype is a representation of a product, design idea, or process. 

#### When And How To Use Prototyping

Prototyping can be done in order to **communicate design ideas** such as with low fidelity prototypes shared amongst team members during the diverging phase or mid-to-high fidelity prototypes that are used as **demonstrations** to stakeholders during stakeholder validation. On the other hand, prototyping can also be done for the purposes of **testing the unbelievable aspects of a design** during the converging process.

:::tip Advantages
* Prototypes can help others **understand design ideas**. Not everyone conceives of a design in the same way and verbal explanations often don’t communicate detailed design ideas clearly. 
* Prototypes can be used in order to **test the unbelievable aspects of a design**. This can be used as a quick feasibility test for team members and stakeholders. 
* These are usually **inexpensive** and don’t require expert craftsmanship.
:::

:::caution Limitations
* A limited or low fidelity prototype **may not address all aspects of a solution or opportunity** and may cause insufficient analysis of crucial points. 
* Using prototypes for testing is **not always representative of the performance of a fully made solution**.
* **Stakeholder confusion** is a real problem that can arise if a prototype is not well developed or difficult to understand. 
:::

:::info Recommended Modifications
* Prototyping at the **wrong fidelity is one of the top prototyping mistakes**. Don’t do more than is necessary, focus on illustrating or testing key ideas. Only when a solution is well developed and close to acceptance should a high fidelity prototype be considered. 
* **Use reference designs to demonstrate that functionality is possible**. If these exist, then there is no need to prototype a function as it is not unbelievable. Time is limited so focus on more meaningful aspects of the design challenge.
